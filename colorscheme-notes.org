#+title: stilla notes

* vscode
    - yellow file title feels too strong
    - strings should include their enclosing quotes in their highlighting
    - do not need to highlight both top and bottom bars for the selected tab - just highlight one. would like the bottom bar to have a bit thicker of a color when highlighted, but not sure if this is possible
      - for jsx: 'from' and the import path aren't distinct enough colors to tell the difference. string vs keyword?
    - highlight for warning should be a more subtle color
    - react component names should have a different color from their props - is this possible?
* browser
  - silly screenshot needs to be removed - it's low effort and distracting
* site
  alignment is off wrt the text
  should be able to use flexbox with a max width to ensure that alignment is preserved: i want 3 rows of oclors on desktop, two on mobile
  add links to the various plugins
